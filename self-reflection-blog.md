## I Was Walking in Circles

For years, I learned DevOps the way most people do—jumping from tutorial to tutorial, collecting tools like trophies, and convincing myself that more content meant more progress.

I learned Docker. Then Kubernetes. Then Jenkins. Then Terraform. Then AWS.

On paper, I was growing. In reality, I was walking in circles.

Despite all those hours of learning, I still didn't have the confidence to apply for a single job. Something was missing, but I couldn't name it. I just felt burned out, overwhelmed, and stuck in a loop I couldn't escape.

## The Wake-Up Call

The turning point came when I finally admitted the truth: I wasn't making progress—I was just staying busy.

I reached out to Mr. Obidi, someone I had been following on Facebook who consistently talked about personal growth. That conversation sparked something in me. For the first time, I stopped running and started reflecting.

What was I actually doing? Why wasn't it working? What needed to change?

That burning desire for change led me to the [DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort-2](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravin-mishra-aws-trainer/). And what surprised me most wasn't the technical curriculum—it was Week 1.

## Week 1: No Code, Just Questions

The first week of DMI had no Docker commands. No CI/CD pipelines. No cloud deployments.

Instead, it had seven reflection assignments:

- What do I believe that others disagree with?
- What truths have I learned through experimentation?
- What does my 2.0 version look like?
- Have I ever cut corners, and how did it feel?
- What books will I read this year?
- What will I measure in my life?
- What's my 5-month system plan?

At first, I wondered why a DevOps program was asking me to think about my feelings, my failures, and my future. But as I worked through each assignment, something clicked.

I wasn't just answering questions. I was meeting myself—maybe for the first time.

## What Self-Reflection Taught Me

### 1. Awareness precedes change

I finally understood why I was stuck. I had been consuming, not building. Wishing, not starting. Learning alone, without accountability. Reflection gave me the clarity that tutorials never could.

### 2. You already have answers—you just haven't asked the questions

When I wrote about my 2.0 version, I realized I already knew who I wanted to become. I just had never written it down. There's power in putting your vision into words.

### 3. Confidence comes from commitment

After completing all seven assignments, I felt something I hadn't felt in years: excitement. I could see how committed I was to this program. Watching the amazing projects Cohort-1 presented during their graduation showed me what's possible. That could be me in five months.

### 4. Once I set out to do it, I can

This was my biggest discovery. I had spent years doubting myself, waiting to feel ready. But this week proved that when I commit, I deliver. The problem was never my ability—it was my lack of direction.

## A Message to the Tutorial Loopers

If you're grinding through tutorials right now, feeling busy but not progressing, I have one thing to say:

**Never stop learning—even if you feel stuck in the loop.**

But while you learn, start reflecting. Ask yourself hard questions. Build the right network. Seek mentors and accountability partners.

One day, an algorithm will show you exactly what you've been longing for. For me, it was the DevOps Micro Internship. For you, it might be something else.

But you won't recognize it unless you've done the inner work first.

## Final Thought

> Self-reflection isn't a distraction from your journey to greatness. It's the foundation of it.

Before you build systems for companies, build a system for yourself. Before you automate pipelines, understand your own patterns. Before you deploy to the cloud, get clear on where you're going.

The most important project you'll ever work on is yourself.

**Start there.**
